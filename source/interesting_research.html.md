# Interesting Graph Research Projects with Possible Gunrock Applicability

We may see papers during the course of our work lives that have possible applicability to Gunrock. There's three steps to making use of those:

1. Add these papers here.
2. Summarize what those papers do.
3. Ascertain with the aid of Gunrock-internals experts if these are worth pursuing (as core-Gunrock projects, as projects for new students, and/or as possible external projects). If we know they're good, we can add them to the main docs [here](https://gunrock.github.io/docs/#possible-gunrock-projects).

Your todo: Add your summary below for any of these! And/or add your assessment on how well it'd work in Gunrock!

## The broker queue: A fast, linearizable FIFO queue for fine-granular work distribution on the GPU
