<h1 id='road-map'>Road Map</h1>
<p>We have three principal near-term priorities for Gunrock development (as of June 2019):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Gunrock&#39;s 1.0 release focused on single-GPU performance. We expect to target single-node multi-GPU support in a near-term future release.</p></li>
<li><p>We believe dynamic (mutable) graphs are a practically interesting area of graph analytics that has not been a focus of the GPU graph analytics research community.</p></li>
<li><p>We will ensure that Gunrock will integrate with NVIDIA&#39;s <a href="https://rapids.ai/">RAPIDS</a> suite of software libraries to accelerate data science workloads on GPUs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also continue to pursue projects in scalability (within a node, across nodes, and across the CPU-GPU boundary); in programmability, including working with the MIT <a href="http://graphit-lang.org/">GraphIt</a> team; in improving Gunrock&#39;s internals, both their performance and their modularity; in expanding the number and coverage of applications written in Gunrock; and in better interoperability with other tools, languages, and libraries.</p>
