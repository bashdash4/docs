<h1 id='acknowledgments'>Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>Thanks to the following developers who contributed code: The connected-component implementation was derived from code written by Jyothish Soman, Kothapalli Kishore, and P. J. Narayanan and described in their IPDPSW &#39;10 paper <em>A Fast GPU Algorithm for Graph Connectivity</em> (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470817">DOI</a>). The breadth-first search implementation and many of the utility functions in Gunrock are derived from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/back40computing/">b40c</a> library of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/duanemerrill/">Duane Merrill</a>. The algorithm is described in his PPoPP &#39;12 paper <em>Scalable GPU Graph Traversal</em> (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2370036.2145832">DOI</a>). Thanks to Erich Elsen and Vishal Vaidyanathan from <a href="http://www.royal-caliber.com/">Royal Caliber</a> and the <a href="http://www.onu.io/">Onu</a> Team for their discussion on library development and the dataset auto-generating code. Thanks to Adam McLaughlin for his technical discussion. Thanks to Oded Green for his technical discussion and an optimization in the CC primitive. Thanks to the <a href="https://altair-viz.github.io/">Altair</a> and <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-lite</a> teams in the <a href="http://idl.cs.washington.edu/">Interactive Data Lab</a> at the University of Washington for graphing help. We appreciate the technical assistance, advice, and machine access from many colleagues at NVIDIA: Chandra Cheij, Joe Eaton, Michael Garland, Mark Harris, Ujval Kapasi, David Luebke, Duane Merrill, Josh Patterson, Nikolai Sakharnykh, and Cliff Woolley.</p>
